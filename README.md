### Access the [calculator](https://lucaso-silva.github.io/calculator--CTD/) 

## Overview
This Calculator was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

> Status: Concluded 

---

### Objectives
- Build the optimal layout for the app depending on the device's screen size ‚úÖ
- Develop the four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division ‚úÖ
- Develop the functionalities of:
  - Clear the numbers inputted in the previous operation field (CE) ‚úÖ 
  - Clear all the information shown in the calculator's screen (C) ‚úÖ 
  - Delete the last digit inputted (DEL) ‚úÖ 
  - Show the operation result by clicking on the Equals button  ‚úÖ

## Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript
- Flexbox
- CSS-grid


## What I learned üí°
Through this project, I could develop using an important programming paradigm: Object-oriented programming. Inside the field of OOP I could improve my knowledge about the use of Classes and Constructor in JavaScript. 

First, was necessary to create a class which I named Calculator, and its constructor, which receives the parameters necessary to initialize the application.

```JavaScript
class Calculator {
  constructor(previousOperationContent, currentOperationContent) {
    this.previousOperationText = previousOperationContent;
    this.currentOperationText = currentOperationContent;

    this.currentOperation = "";
  }

  addDigit(digit) {
    this.currentOperation = digit;
    this.updateScreen();
  }

  processOperation(operation) {
    if (this.currentOperationText.innerText === "" && operation !== "C") {
      if (this.previousOperationText.innerText !== "") {
        this.changeOperation(operation);
      }

      return;
    }
```
Another important concept to highlight when developing using Classes is the possibility to create specific functions inside the class, these functions are named methods. Through the example above are shown the methods `addDigit()` and `processOperation()`

I also learned to use the `switch` statement, which is a multiway branch statement, providing an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.

It‚Äôs another way to work with conditions in JavaScript, replacing the use of `if-else`statement.
```JavaScript
switch (operation) {
      case "+":
        operationValue = previous + current;
        this.updateScreen(operationValue, operation, current, previous);
        break;
      case "-":
        operationValue = previous - current;
        this.updateScreen(operationValue, operation, current, previous);
        break;
      case "*":
        operationValue = previous * current;
        this.updateScreen(operationValue, operation, current, previous);
        break;
      case "/":
        operationValue = previous / current;
        this.updateScreen(operationValue, operation, current, previous);
        break;
      case "=":
        this.equalOperation();
        break;
      case "CE":
        this.clearCurrentOperation();
        break;
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Continued development

The next steps can be focused on implementing more calculator functionalities.
